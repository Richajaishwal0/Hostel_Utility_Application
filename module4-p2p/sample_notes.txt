Data Structures and Algorithms - Chapter 1 Notes

1. Introduction to Data Structures
   - Arrays: Linear collection of elements
   - Linked Lists: Dynamic data structure
   - Stacks: LIFO (Last In First Out)
   - Queues: FIFO (First In First Out)

2. Algorithm Analysis
   - Time Complexity: Big O notation
   - Space Complexity: Memory usage
   - Best, Average, Worst case scenarios

3. Basic Operations
   - Insertion: Adding elements
   - Deletion: Removing elements  
   - Searching: Finding elements
   - Traversal: Visiting all elements

4. Applications
   - Database indexing
   - Memory management
   - Network routing
   - File systems
